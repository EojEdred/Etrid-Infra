### Project Description

**Short Description (300 characters max):**
```
Ëtrid is a next-generation multichain network featuring PrimeArc relay chain and Partition Burst Chains (PBCs), enabling secure, scalable, and interoperable blockchain infrastructure with the native ËTR token for payments, staking, and governance.
```

**Detailed Description:**
```
## Overview

Ëtrid (ËTR) is the native token of the Ëtrid multichain ecosystem, powering the PrimeArc Core Chain and Partition Burst Chains (PBCs). Ëtrid provides enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure with advanced consensus mechanisms and seamless interoperability.

## Key Features

- **PrimeArc Core Chain:** Substrate-based relay chain providing security and coordination
- **Partition Burst Chains (PBCs):** Application-specific parachains for BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, BNB, TRX, and more
- **E320 Governance Framework:** Decentralized governance with on-chain voting
- **Virtual Machine Watts (VMw):** Efficient gas metering system
- **Consensus Day:** Unique quarterly consensus mechanism for network upgrades

## Token Utility

- **Payments:** Transaction fees across PrimeArc and PBCs
- **Staking:** Validator staking and collator bonds
- **Governance:** E320 proposal voting and parameter adjustment
- **Gas:** VMw gas payments for smart contract execution
- **Rewards:** Validator and collator rewards

## Tokenomics

- Total Supply: 2,521,014,000 ËTR (Fixed)
- Minting: Disabled (fixed supply forever)
- Initial Circulating: 10,000,000 ËTR
- Network: Solana (SPL Token)

## Technology

Built on Substrate framework with custom pallets for:
- Multichain coordination
- Cross-chain bridges (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
- Decentralized identity (Open DID)
- Smart contract execution (ETWasm VM)
- Peer-to-peer networking (DETR-P2P)

### Team Information

**Is your team anonymous?**
```
Partial - developed by distributed team of blockchain engineers
```

---

### Audit Information

**Has the token contract been audited?**
```
Standard Solana SPL Token implementation (audited by Solana Labs)
```

---

### Additional Information

**What makes your project unique?**
```
Ëtrid is the first multichain network to combine:

1. Substrate-based relay chain (PrimeArc) with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, BNB, and Tron-specific parachains
2. Quarterly "Consensus Day" for coordinated network-wide upgrades
3. E320 governance framework with 320-member validator set
4. Native cross-chain bridges without external dependencies
5. VMw gas system for predictable transaction costs
6. Open DID decentralized identity integration

Unlike existing multichain solutions, Ëtrid provides purpose-built Partition Burst Chains for each major blockchain ecosystem while maintaining security through the PrimeArc Core Chain.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Before Submitting:

1. **Website Status:** Make sure https://etrid.org is live and has basic info about ËTR
   - If not live yet, wait until it is

2. **Trading Volume:** CMC prefers to see some trading activity
   - Do a few test trades on Raydium first
   - $1000+ in daily volume helps approval

3. **Social Media:** Make sure your Twitter/Telegram are active
   - Post about the launch
   - Engage with community

4. **Wait for Token List:** It's better to submit AFTER your Solana Token List PR is merged
   - Shows legitimacy
   - Logo already appears on explorers

### Recommended Timeline:

- **Today:** Submit to Solana Token List ✅ (DONE)
- **Wait 3-7 days:** For Token List approval
- **Then Submit:** CoinMarketCap (better approval chances)
- **Same Day:** CoinGecko (submit alongside CMC)
