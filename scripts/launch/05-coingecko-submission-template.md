**Ticker/Symbol:**
```
ÉTR
```

**Project Website:**

```

**Project Description (200-300 words):**
```
Ëtrid is a next-generation multichain network consisting of the PrimeArc Core Chain (Substrate-based relay chain) and Partition Burst Chains (PBCs) - purpose-built parachains for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, BNB, Tron, and other major blockchain ecosystems.

The ÉTR token serves as the native currency powering the entire Ëtrid network, used for transaction fees, validator staking, governance participation, and smart contract gas payments via the Virtual Machine Watts (VMw) system.

Ëtrid introduces the E320 Governance Framework with 320 validators and a unique "Consensus Day" mechanism for quarterly network upgrades coordinated across all chains simultaneously. This enables seamless protocol evolution while maintaining security and decentralization.

Key features include:
- Native cross-chain bridges without external dependencies
- Quantum-resistant cryptography roadmap
- Open DID decentralized identity integration
- ETWasm smart contract virtual machine
- DETR-P2P networking protocol
- E320 governance with on-chain voting

Built on Substrate framework, Ëtrid combines the security of relay chain architecture with the flexibility of application-specific chains, enabling true interoperability across blockchain ecosystems.
