### Project Description

**Short Description (300 characters max):**
```
Ëtrid is a next-generation multichain network featuring PrimeArc Core Chain and Partition Burst Chains (PBCs), enabling secure, scalable, and interoperable blockchain infrastructure with native ETR token for payments, staking, and governance.
```

**Detailed Description:**
```
## Overview

Ëtrid (ÉTR) is the native token of the Ëtrid multichain ecosystem, powering the PrimeArc Core Chain and Partition Burst Chains (PBCs). Ëtrid provides enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure with advanced consensus mechanisms, quantum-resistant security, and seamless interoperability.

## Key Features

- **PrimeArc Core Chain:** Substrate-based relay chain providing security and coordination
- **Partition Burst Chains (PBCs):** Application-specific parachains for BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, BNB, TRX, and more
- **E320 Governance Framework:** Decentralized governance with on-chain voting
- **Virtual Machine Watts (VMw):** Efficient gas metering system
- **Consensus Day:** Unique quarterly consensus mechanism for network upgrades

## Token Utility

- **Payments:** Transaction fees across PrimeArc and PBCs
- **Staking:** Validator staking and collator bonds
- **Governance:** E320 proposal voting and parameter adjustment
- **Gas:** VMw gas payments for smart contract execution
- **Rewards:** Validator and collator rewards

## Tokenomics

- Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 ÉTR (Fixed)
- Initial Circulating: [XX,XXX,XXX] ÉTR
- Distribution:
  - Foundation Reserve: 40%
  - Validator Rewards: 25%
  - Development Fund: 20%
  - Initial DEX Offering: 10%
  - Team & Advisors: 5% (12-month lock)

## Technology

Built on Substrate framework with custom pallets for:
- Multichain coordination
- Cross-chain bridges (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
- Decentralized identity (Open DID)
- Smart contract execution (ETWasm VM)
- Peer-to-peer networking (DETR-P2P)

### Additional Information

**What makes your project unique?**
```
Ëtrid is the first multichain network to combine:

1. Substrate-based relay chain (PrimeArc) with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, BNB, and Tron-specific parachains
2. Quarterly "Consensus Day" for coordinated network-wide upgrades
3. E320 governance framework with 320-member validator set
4. Native cross-chain bridges without external dependencies
5. VMw gas system for predictable transaction costs
6. Quantum-resistant cryptography roadmap
7. Open DID decentralized identity integration

Unlike existing multichain solutions, Ëtrid provides purpose-built Partition Burst Chains for each major blockchain ecosystem while maintaining security through the PrimeArc Core Chain.
